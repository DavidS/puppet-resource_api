# Resource API hands-on lab

This lab will walk you through the basic steps of creating a native integration with puppet. After this you will have a fully functioning module to manage Philips HUE lights and have seen all the bits fall into place.

These labs are intended for new and experienced developers alike. Please post feedback and suggestions for improvement in the [issues section](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-resource_api/issues).

Start with [installing the Puppet Development Kit](./hands-on-lab/01-installing-prereqs.md)
