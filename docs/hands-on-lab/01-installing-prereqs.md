# Install the Puppet Development Kit and other tools

To start out, install the Puppet Development Kit (PDK), which will provide all necessary tools and libraries to build and test modules. Additionally we recommend an emulator for the target device of this lab, a code editor with good ruby and puppet support, and GIT, a version control system to keep track of our progress.

1. Choose your platform from https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit; download and install the package

2. If you do not have a Philips HUE hub available, you can download the [Hue-Emulator](https://github.com/SteveyO/Hue-Emulator/raw/master/HueEmulator-v0.8.jar). You will need to have Java installed to run this.

3. To edit code, we recommend the cross-platform editor [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), with the [Ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby) and [Puppet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpogran.puppet-vscode) extensions. There are lots of other extensions that can help you with your development workflow.

4. Git is a version control system that helps you keep track of changes and collaborate with others. In the course of the hands-on lab, we will show some integrations with cloud services that can help you. If you never used git before, skip this and all related steps for now.
